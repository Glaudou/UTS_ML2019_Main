In some companies, especially the small ones, it is difficult to have someone working on it as it would cost some more money, but it also takes a lot of time to prepare and to be sure that you are right with the law.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are some projects using machine learning in order to make it easier, but it's basically recognising when someone wants to plan something using word recognition and/or checking if the planned time slot is not already used, trying to find an optimal slot by looking at the data in the previous weeks to see which next free slot is the most used, if it is the case.It's not about trying to optimize the quality of the work and the working conditions. The closest to this project is about using genetic machine learning algorithms to create the timetables.\n"

        "It's really important to have timetables and sometimes they are very hard to make. The two things that an enterprise would win in using this kind of timetable maker is a lot of time which would allow to re-focus the manpower to work other tasks and, therefore, spend less money. As I said earlier, small companies can't afford to pay someone to do it and they don't have the time to do it too, so it is a system that could replace the human on a minor, but still important, action.\n",
        "\n",
        "On this project, the objective is to have an algorithm helping in making an optimized timetable (that would be a Decision Support System which is just a system that helps in making decision but the final choice is still made by a human) or that it could even make it by itself. For instance, according to a country, the law can sometimes be difficult to grasp in its entirety so after putting the type of work and all the specifications of the employee, it would know how to organize its time slots and in accordance with the other employees to optimize the working productions and the working hours. The timetable maker could also be used in schools. In some countries, such as France for instance, students can't choose their time slots for their classes, it is made by the school staff. The timetable could be used to optimize their timetable in order for them not to have to spend much time travelling forth and back from school, losing precious working time.\n",

        "2.   Classify each employee according to their jobs and working rights;\n",

        "4. Simulate them in order to get the best timetable possible;\n",
        "5. Read the data of previous results or simulations made before;\n",
        "6. Choose the bests (maybe 3 for instance) timetables that it created and propose them to the manager to choose amongst them;\n",
        "7. If the manager is not satisfied with any of the proposed timetables, he / she could decide to either re-run the program with the same parameters or with some new parameters, increase the number of choices to see some others made by the program or decide to do it himself / herself.\n",

        "The assessment / comparison of the best timetables would be made with previous data (previous results or simulations of working productions) and according to the demand of the goods the company needs to product (which can vary according to the month for instance) the quantity of workers variate. Of course, as the time passes the new data and their real-life result would be added which would improve the accuracy or totally modify the way of creating the timetables.\n",

        "It is important to say that the \"Collecting data\" should be done beforehand since it takes a lot more time than the 4 months allocated to it. The thing is, during this time, it should be good to ask several companies to give more data to improve the accuracy and work on several cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "The outcome of this project should be to help managers in creating timetable faster and optimized in order to improve the working conditions of the employees, which involves improving the quality of the work and therefore more benefits. Moreover, since it makes it faster, the managers have more time to focus on their other tasks. With this project, it is clear that investors would spend less money and their employees would work smarter.\n",
        "Also, the project will be sold to other companies with a price varying on the number of employees the company has since the more employees, the stronger the servers are needed to be since there are more data to stock."
